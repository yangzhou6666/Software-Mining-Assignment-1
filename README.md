# Part 1

First, we split the original dataset into train and test sets.
```
python split.py
```

Before training the SVM classifier, we need to compile the tool.
```
cd svm_light
make
```

Then, we can train the SVM classifier on the training data.
```
svm_light/svm_learn part_1/train.txt part_1/model
```

Now we can use the obtained model to classify the test set.
```
svm_light/svm_classify part_1/test.txt part_1/model part_1/result.txt
```

We obtain the following results on the testing data:
* Accuracy on test set: 71.00% (71 correct, 29 incorrect, 100 total)
* Precision/recall on test set: 66.27%/98.21%
* $F_1 = \frac{2 * PR}{P + R} = 79.13\%$


# Part 2

First, we split the original dataset using 10-folder and stratified 10-folder cross validation. 
```
python cross_validation.py
```

The split results will be stored in `./part_2/k_folder` and `./part_2/s_k_folder`.



## SVM

Assuming that you have compiled SVM classifier in part 1, let's execute the following scripts to run SVM on cross-validation sets.
```
bash part_2_svm.sh
```

The results will be stored under `./part_2/k_folder/log_k.txt` and `./part_2/s_k_folder/log_k.txt`. We summarize the results in the table below.
